A Cornish dictionary in Standard Written Form (SWF). The word list is from Akademi Kernewek (https://www.akademikernewek.org.uk/) and Cornish Language Office (cornishlanguage@cornwall.gov.uk). Their word list is licenced under Creative Commons Non-Commercial (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

The word list has been converted into a Hunspell format dictionary with basic mutation rules and minimal examples of verb conjugations.

This dictionary combines all words from both Revived Middle Cornish (RMC) and Revived Late Cornish (RLC).

Later versions will be more complete and ought to separate out RMC and RLC.
