# Cornish Spell-Checker

> [!NOTE]
> For Non-Commercial Use. See license below.

This is a spell-checker for the Cornish language. It uses word lists in the Standard Written Form that cover both Middle and Late Cornish combined. The spell-checker is based on Hunspell and but is also packaged for other applications that use the Hunspell framework: LibreOffice, Firefox and Thunderbird (email client).

The main part of the spell-checker is derived from the Akademi Kernewek word list provided by the Cornish Language Office. 

Thanks to the Cornish Language Office and Akademi Kernewek for their support in creating this spell-checker, particularly  to Sam Rogerson for his help and advice thoughout this project. Cornish Tools is not affiliated with either Cornish Language Office or Akademi Kernewek.

## Limitations

This spell-checker checks each word independently and does not check grammar. For example, the spell-checker can check whether a word is a valid mutation. For example, *kath* (cat) soft mutates *gath* so the spell-checker will report both words as correct. However, the spell-checker cannot tell whether the mutation is valid in the context of the sentence. For example, *an kath* and *an gath* (the cat) both have correctly spelled words so the spell-checker would report both as correct, but only *an gath* is gramatically correct.

> [!NOTE]
> The spell-checker is not complete, there is still coverage to improve (see the scores below). Some of the known gaps in coverage are listed [under issues](https://github.com/cornish-tools/cornish-spellchecker/issues). If you encounter an issue, please help us by [raising it here](https://github.com/cornish-tools/cornish-spellchecker/issues).

### Scores

Current scores:
![](badge/test-total-words.svg)
![](badge/test-unique-words.svg)
![](badge/test-unique-noneng-words.svg)

The scores show an approximation of the coverage of the spell-checker. They are calculated from sample text in Standard Written Form. The total word coverage is the proportion of words from the text that pass the spell-checker. The unique words coverage is the proportion of words that pass the spell-checker by unique spelling. The non-English percentage uses the Ubuntu Hunspell dictionary to exclude words that appear in English, since the sample includes people and company names that are common in English. Scores are out of 1000.
